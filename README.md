# Pocket Arcade

An installable, offline-first collection of casual games for phones and
tablets. No accounts, no ads, no network needed after the first visit: open
the site once, add it to your home screen, and play anywhere.

Play at **https://games.mckoss.com/**. Each game has its own link to share
-- `https://games.mckoss.com/#/morse`, `#/lander`, `#/elevator` and so on --
which opens straight into that game, no install needed, and downloads just
that game (it's then playable offline too). Its level page links back to
the whole arcade.

## Games

- **Benji's Town** -- for little ones: tap the garbage truck, the postal worker's van,
  the dog walker and the cement mixer to send them off to work around a
  little town -- with sidewalks, crosswalks and traffic lights; later,
  drive them along the streets with a finger.
- **Car Jam** -- swipe cars out of a jammed parking lot; mind the grannies.
- **Tap Maze** -- tap arrows to send them off the board, if their path is clear.
- **Breakout** -- the arcade classic, in portrait or landscape.
- **Lunar Lander** -- fly over the mountains and set down gently on the base.
- **Night Driver** -- the 1976 arcade racer: stay between the lights in the dark.
- **Water Lab** -- pour water between beakers to measure an exact amount.
- **Elevator Operator** -- run the lifts through a working day, from a
  six-storey office block to twin towers, against the computer.
- **Morse Rain** -- learn Morse code by ear: hear a letter and tap it in
  the drifting cloud, or key letters yourself and shoot them down.
- **15** -- the sliding puzzle, with numbers, pictures, sequences (a clock,
  the moon, the sun across the sky) or your own photos on any level, and a
  graph of every move against the best possible.
- **Jigsaw** -- turn your own photos into jigsaw puzzles, or a pattern: a
  colour wheel, stained glass, a map and more, new every time.

How each one is meant to play, and the decisions behind it, are in
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Installing on a device

- **iPhone / iPad (Safari):** open the site, tap **Share**, then **Add to
  Home Screen**.
- **Android (Chrome):** open the site and tap **Install** on the banner (or
  ⋮ menu → **Install app**).

Progress is saved on the device.

## Development

There is no build step: the app is plain HTML, CSS and ES modules, drawn on a
canvas, with most sound synthesised; recorded audio and images are welcome
where they make a game better (Lunar Lander has both), cached for offline
play like everything else.

```sh
npm install           # dev dependency: Playwright for the browser tests
npm start             # serve at http://localhost:8080
npm test              # unit tests + headless-browser play-through + offline check
```

After changing any app file, run `npm run build` to refresh the generated
files (`sw-manifest.js` and `js/version.js`); the tests fail if they are stale.

### Versions and updates

The app version is `version` in `package.json` (semver: minor for new games
and features, patch for fixes), shown at the bottom of the home screen and
recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`. Bump it, add a changelog entry and run
`npm run build` for each release. Installed apps check for a new version when
they come back to the foreground (and hourly), then show a prompt naming the
new version; **Update** installs it and reloads.

Other scripts:

- Levels come from `games/car-jam/levels.js`: `specFor(n)` is the difficulty
  curve and `makeLevel(n)` builds level *n* from `seedFor(n)`. Every level is
  verified solvable and its par is the solver's optimum. Bump `GEN_VERSION`
  when generation changes so levels cached on devices are rebuilt.
- `npm run icons`: re-render the PNG app icons from `icons/icon.svg`.

```

### Adding a game

Create `games/<id>/index.js` exporting `mount(element, ctx, route)` that
returns `{ route(sub), destroy() }`, add an entry to `js/games.js`, and run
`npm run build`.

### Analytics

`js/lib/analytics.js` reports to Google Analytics 4 (the mckoss.com property,
`G-GBPSK1HQ34`). Events are queued on the device and sent whenever it is
online, so play while offline is uploaded on the next connection (tagged with
`queued_minutes`). Events: `page_view`, `app_open` (installed vs browser),
`app_installed`, `level_start`, `level_complete` (with `stars`) and
`level_fail`, each with `game` and `level`. Nothing is sent from localhost.

### Deployment

The app is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
runs the tests on every push and, on `main`, publishes the site to Pages at
https://games.mckoss.com/ (custom domain set in Settings → Pages). One-time setup: Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome -- new games, or fixes to the ones here. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): one thing per pull request, rebased on
the latest `main`, `npm test` passing; they're squash-merged by hand.
